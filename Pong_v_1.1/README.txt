DESC:
	Two player Pong game. There is no playable AI at the moment (AI has been
	implemented but not trained). Score to win is 10, after which the game 
	restarts at 0.
	
CONTROLS:
	Player 1:
		A / Z for up/down, respectively
	Player 2:
		K / M for the same.
	
	General:
		ESCAPE will exit.
		
KNOWN BUGS:
	None.
	
FUTURE PLANS:
	- Train AI (AI uses genetic algorithm, so it needs to play the game to get
	  better).
	- Add menu.
